# Review-Finder
Look up a business* and see reviews.
Enter in a search term and criteria based on predetermined tags. Get a list of businesses and upon selection get a list of reviews.
Have the ability to create your own list of businesses* and add notes to that business/list.  

Have a list show up on a map to see how you might have to navigate your places of interest.  

*businesses or things that will show up in a yelp search

# List creation
Tied to a user account. Possibly with the idea of having the lists be viewable by other users.  

# Create a review --stretch
Have the user be able to write a review and post to Yelp and Google.  
I do want to add something else like "here are directions to place" or "weather is good/bad"  
I think the core of the idea is getting reviews and creating lists for now though.
